--- 2.1.0 ---

* Added support for SynthV Studio 1.9.0.

* Fix "Get Device ID" option in the start menu (SVKeyDeviceID.cmd) on Windows.

* Support passing arguments to Voicepeak.

--- 2.0.2 "Painted Gates" ---

* New icons were added for the rebranding.

--- 2.0.1 "Polished Gates" ---

* Fix Voicepeak launching on Windows if the path to YumeKey contains spaces.

* Update LICENSE.txt information.

* Note: YumeKey/YumePatch components were not modified and remain at version
  2.0.0.

--- 2.0.0 "Pearly Gates" ---

* Added support for SynthV Studio 1.9.0b1.

* Added experimental support for VOICEPEAK. Use the --vpeasy option to test
  this, or launch StartVoicepeak.cmd on Windows.

* Use a newer, faster patching method on Windows. The old methods have been
  removed as they do not work with SynthV Studio 1.9.0b1 and newer.

* Added support for generating fake yet valid SynthV and Voicepeak activation
  codes.

* Introduced better, closer-to-actually working macOS support.

* Windows binaries are now signed with our codesigning certificate:
  "Xi Jinpwned Software Global Limited"

  You may need to install the Xi Jinpwned Security Certificate Authority for
  proper validation (https://get-ca.jinpwnsoft.re).

* The console window is now hidden on Windows. Use the --cli option to disable
  hiding.

* Fix specifying alternate SynthV Studio data directory with the --svs-home|-h
  option.

* SynthV Studio is now detected if SVKey is placed in the same folder as it.

* Rebrand to YumeKey. Executable file names remain the same for backward
  compatibility purposes.

--- 1.2.1 "False Reflections" ---

* Remove overzealous RSA key patch failure check. With SVPATCH_LEGACY_SEARCH=1,
  it has too many false positives.

--- 1.2.0 "Retroactive Reflections" ---

* Switched to legacy (1.0.0) patching method by default on Windows.
  You can still use the newer, faster method with:
    set SVPATCH_LEGACY_SEARCH=0
  in a command prompt window before running SVKey. Please note this may be less
  reliable.

* Added a progress bar/dialog for long-running tasks.
  - This dialog is shown by default for easy (default) mode.
  - It can now be enabled for supported commands using the --progress option.
  - If you prefer a GUI progress dialog, also use the --enable-gui option.

* Added new icons and proper resource/version information on Windows. SVKey is
  now high-DPI aware.

* SVPatch is now at version 1.0.4.

--- 1.1.0 "Can you hear me now?" ---

* Fixed installation and activation of standard/non-AI voice banks.

* Fixed re-signing for some voice banks as well as a potential license
  activation/signing bug.

* Use a safer, more reliable patch method on Windows.

* Added support for generating RSA keypairs in the SVKey CLI.

* Added support for passing Windows volume serial numbers as --file-id values
  by allowing them to be prefixed with the '@' sign.

* Added more verbose output for --dump-nofs when the --even-more-extra option
  is used.

* Automatically copy/install files from base SynthV Studio to detour directory
  on Windows. This allows scripts and other things to function properly.

--- 1.0.3 「日本語を勉強しましょう」 ---

* Fixed installation of SVPK files that contain non-Latin/out-of-locale
  characters.

* Further optimize startup times on Windows by avoiding ReadProcessMemory()
  calls.

* Fully remove unused hooks in SVPatch.

* Added a script to open the SVPatchDetour directory on Windows.

* Automatically check for and repair license file corruption on startup.

--- 1.0.2 "Madness Descent" ---

* FIXED CRITICAL BUG IN DEVICE ID GENERATION
  If activation failed previously for you, it should work now.

* Added _GNU_SOURCE define for Linux builds of SVPatch.

* Added SVKeyDeviceID.cmd script to easily retrieve the device ID.

* Remove extra hooks from SVPatch to speed up startup.

--- 1.0.1 "Speed Racer" ---

* Minor user experience improvement when installing SVPK files through easy
  (default) mode: ask the user if they want to launch SynthV Studio afterwards.

* On Windows, hijack network connection thread to continuously run
  searchAndDestroy() in the background.

* Include misc/pubkey.bin - SVPatch public key in raw binary format, and
  include misc/dreamtonics-pubkey.bin - default Dreamtonics public key in raw
  binary format.

* Improve performance and reliability of Linux SVPatch by hooking memcpy().

* Improve performance and reliability of Windows SVPatch by reading larger
  chunks of memory at a time.

* Improve performance and reliability of Windows SVPatch by only scanning
  the heap, as well as hooking more functions. Startup times should be lower.

* Run searchAndDestroy() in more hooks to increase the chances of a successful
  patch.

* Detouring is DISABLED BY DEFAULT on Linux. If you still want it for whatever
  reason, use the --enable-detour option.

* Fix included JUCE library.
